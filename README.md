# Inkbex - Batch export from SVG files using Inkscape

Inkbex is a wrapper of the Inkscape export commands for easily exporting from multiple SVG files using "glob" patterns (e.g. *.svg). In order for Inkbex to work you must have Inkscape installed on your system and added to your PATH.

Example:
```
inkbex *.svg --dpi 300
```
